## Installation
To get started with the project, first ensure you have pnpm installed. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
cd hangman-game
pnpm install
```
## Usage
To run the server locally, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server and you can view the game by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

That's it! Happy Coding! ðŸ«°
